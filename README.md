# Playwright Python Automation Framework

A lightweight, enterprise-style test automation framework built with **Playwright**, **Python**, and **PyTest**.

This project demonstrates best practices in UI test automation, including the Page Object Model (POM), data-driven testing, automatic screenshot capture, video recording, trace recording, logging, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.

The framework was developed as part of my continuous learning to strengthen my Playwright skills while leveraging my professional experience in Selenium, Python, and enterprise QA automation.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Playwright
- PyTest
- Git
- GitHub Actions
- JSON
- HTML Report

---

## Framework Design

The framework follows a modular design that separates responsibilities:

- **Pages** – Page Object Model classes
- **Tests** – Test scenarios
- **Utils** – Helper classes, configuration, logging and JSON reader
- **Data** – Test data stored in JSON format
- **Conftest** – Browser fixtures and PyTest hooks

This design improves maintainability, readability and scalability.

---

## Test Features

### Manual Features

- Functional Testing
- Regression Testing
- Smoke Testing
- UI Validation

### Automation Features

- Page Object Model
- Data-driven testing
- Reusable fixtures
- Automatic browser management

---

## Failure Handling

When a test fails, the framework automatically:

- Captures a screenshot
- Records browser video
- Saves a Playwright trace
- Generates an HTML report

These artefacts make debugging much easier.

## Running the Project

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cromox1/playwright-python-framework.git
```

---

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Install Playwright browsers

```bash
playwright install
```

---

### Run all tests

```bash
pytest
```

---

### Generate HTML Report

```bash
pytest --html=report.html
```

---

## View Playwright Trace

```bash
playwright show-trace traces/<trace-file>.zip
```

The Trace Viewer allows you to replay the complete test execution, inspect each action, review network requests, console logs and DOM snapshots.

---

## Continuous Integration

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically:

- Install dependencies
- Install Playwright browsers
- Execute all tests
- Verify that the framework runs successfully

Every push to the repository automatically triggers the workflow.

---

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- API Testing
- Parallel execution
- Cross-browser execution
- Allure reporting
- Docker support
- Environment configuration
- Jenkins integration
- Azure DevOps pipeline
- Playwright fixtures optimisation
- Test tagging (Smoke, Regression, Sanity)
